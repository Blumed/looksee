#Looksee
Type in class's, id's, element's, anything that you would use in a `$('Selector')` to have a quick looksee at your layout. The idea here is to add borders and shaders on the fly.  You could add the styles and markup to your project and remove it later, but why do that when you could quickly target the markup you need to see. 

Head to your favorite webpage and try these on for size:

`*` - Select everything inside the body

`p:even` - Select all even `p` tags

`input[type="email"]` - Select all `input` tags with the type attribute email

##Usecases
1. Quickly identify specific markup on a webpage. Find all the header tags
2. Have you ever viewed your project on a phone/tablet and the site was bigger than the viewport which allowed you to move the site left and right? I know it has happened to me once or twice. Looksee will help you find that pesky child element on the double!
